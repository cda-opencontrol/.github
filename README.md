MSS - Multi Sensory System

ABOUT
------------------
During a long period of research, the Centre d'Ambiance (CdA) developed a way of creating an emotional world through the congruent use of all the senses, to which humans are particularly emotionally responsive. In addition to general moods, special feel-good oases can be created for specific target groups, e.g. for people in need of care, people in shopping mode or for the subconscious/targeted placement of marketing messages.

This project is dedicated to the technical control over which the different communication channels are managed. This includes the OpenControl Server, Media libraries that support the mood or products, music that sets the pace and scents and lighting worlds that enchant the atmosphere in the building or store into feeling oases. 

These channels can be easily combined and rendered for the customer to understand the message. The result is an individually adapted sensory oasis that not only puts customers in a positive mood as emotional beings, but also benefits the staff.


RELEASES & ROADMAP
------------------
The notation has changed in the course of development. The versioning describes the system functionality and follows a fixed scheme consisting of 3 number ranges like Ex. 4.1.203

Requirements are captured by the project team and usually formulate the 'use case' as well.
