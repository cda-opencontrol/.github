During a long period of research, the Centre d'Ambiance (CdA) developed a way of creating an emotional world through the congruent use of all the senses, to which humans are particularly emotionally responsive. In addition to general moods, special feel-good oases can be created for specific target groups, such as people in need of care, people in shopper mode or for the targeted placement of marketing messages.

This project is dedicated to the control over which the different communication channels are managed. This includes media libraries (videos and images) that support the mood or products, music that sets the pace, scents and lighting worlds that enchant the atmosphere in the building or store into feeling oases. 

These can be easily combined and rendered for the customer to understand the message. The result is an individually adapted sensory oasis that not only puts customers in a positive mood as emotional beings, but also benefits the staff.
